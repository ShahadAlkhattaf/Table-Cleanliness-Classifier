# Table-Cleanliness-Classifier
This project explores image classification using a lightweight model trained via Google Teachable Machine. It highlights a basic use case for detecting table conditions through visual input. Built using **Google Teachable Machine** and **TensorFlow (Keras format)**. 
It can be useful in smart restaurant systems or cleaning services. Instead of checking tables manually, it uses AI to look at a photo and tell if the table is clean or not.
